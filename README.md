# 348_Project
The purpose of this project is for SN2ARK to develop a multifunctional arithmetic expression evaluator utilizing C++. The objective is to create a simulation of a calculator, through a program, 
that is able to handle expressions as input and calculate the result using mathematical operations like (PEMDAS). Furthermore, SN2ARK will fully integrate the Software Development Process through
timely deliverables within the semester. These deliverables include a detailed project plan, a requirements document, a design document that is in alignment with the requirements, a set of test cases, 
and a fully-developed product. As part of the scope of this project, each iteration should be timely and in-line with the functionality of the requirements.
